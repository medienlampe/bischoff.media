  My fascination for the web and its underlying technology started more
  than ten years ago and hasn't left me since. I really enjoy the design
  and creation process of web applications and their contents. This
  doesn't end by just deploying them. A web application is more than
  it's code, it's a webserver, an operating system, a hardware stack and
  also includes automation, backups, virtualization and containers.
  Every part of that is interesting and amazing on its own and all are
  working together for a great experience.

  Apart from that I'm quite interested in photography, music, science
  and DIY. I also like to research topics I'm interested in and am a
